-- CourtSide · undo for migration 20261103000211_city_board_all_time.
--
-- NOT A MIGRATION (it belongs in supabase/rollback/, outside supabase/migrations
-- on purpose). Run it in the Supabase SQL editor as one piece only to take 211
-- back out. All-or-nothing; safe to run more than once.
--
-- It puts refresh_city_board(), city_board() and city_page() back exactly as
-- they were before 211 (checked letter for letter at the end) and removes the
-- all-time board's rows (month '2000-01-01': numbers and ids only). Months are
-- untouched. Do this only with the app's CITY_BOARD_ALL_TIME off again (an app
-- still asking for '2000-01-01' would get "month out of range" and show
-- "Couldn't load the board").
